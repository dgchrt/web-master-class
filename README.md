Web Master Class

This master class will teach you how to become proficient as a web developer, with the necessary disciplines that you need to understand along the way, so that you become a master yourself. To achieve this particular goal, there will be no hand holding: you'll be given some essential pointers, but it is your job to seek the knowledge yourself.

## Introduction
Welcome to this master class. I'm excited that you are here. By the end of this journey you should have a good grasp of what it means to be a software engineer in its formation, or at least a competent web developer. There are no prerequisites and knowledge seekers of all levels are welcome to learn a thing or two from this material.

## Terminal
In the beginning, there was just the terminal. Actually, in the real beginning not even that, but we can fast forward to taking it for granted. Fancy graphical desktop environments came much later, and they never replaced the terminal. And you're about to learn why.

The day of any decent software engineer begins and ends in the Terminal. Go ahead, open your "Terminal" application, unless you are already in it. Let's cover some basics.

### How to interact with it
Here's the deal: from now on, whenever you see a block like this:
```shell
ls
```
You will just type it in the terminal, exactly how it's written, line by line, hitting "Enter" at the end of each line. Deal? Then look at what that `ls` command you just typed produced. You should see a list of the files in the current directory (also known as a folder). And what would such "current folder" be, you might ask? Luckily, there's another command to answer that too:
```shell
pwd
```
