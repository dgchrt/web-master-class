Web Master Class

This master class will teach you how to become proficient as a web developer, with the necessary disciplines that you need to understand along the way, so that you become a master yourself. To achieve this particular goal, there will be no hand holding: you'll be given some essential pointers, but it is your job to seek the knowledge yourself.

## Introduction
Welcome to this master class. I'm glad that you are here. By the end of this journey, you should have a good grasp of what it means to be a software engineer, or at least a competent web developer. Ok, in the very least, I wish you to become a self-sufficient power user. There are no prerequisites and knowledge seekers of all levels are welcome to learn a thing or two from this material.

Important: this document makes no assumptions about what kind of computer system you are using. Since you're here, you're most likely using some POSIX-compliant system, but it doesn't have to be. In any case, it's also your job to make sure you make the essential tools we're covering in your own computer system. So if you ever stumble upon something that doesn't work as expected, I'm pretty sure you can use [a decent search engine](https://www.ecosia.org/) and search for some instructions on how to install and make such thing work on your own system of choice. You did choose your current system, didn't you?

## Terminal
In the beginning, there was just the terminal. Actually, in the real beginning not even that, but we live in privileged times and we can fast forward to taking it for granted. Fancy graphical desktop environments came much later, but they never replaced the terminal. And you're about to learn why. Picture this: the desktop environment is to the terminal pretty much what early sketching inside caves is to modern written language. If you want to convey advanced instructions, pointing at icons becomes very limiting, very quickly.

The day of any decent software engineer begins and ends in the terminal. Go ahead, open your "Terminal" application, unless you are already in it. Let's cover some basics now.

### How to interact with it
Here's the deal: from now on, whenever you see a block like this:

```shell
ls
```

You will just type it in the terminal, exactly how it's written, line by line, hitting "Enter" at the end of each line. Deal? Then look at what that `ls` command you just typed produced. You should see a list of the contents in the working directory (also known as current folder). And what would such "working directory" be, you might ask? Luckily, there's another command to answer that:

```shell
pwd
```

You might see something that ends with your username. Not sure? Well, you guessed, there's also another command for that too:

```shell
whoami
```

You see? Typing in the terminal is quite analog to having a chat with your computer. Except instead of using some wild natural language, you're using a formal language, which is unambiguous.

### Navigating directories
Now that you know how to list the contents of the working directory, you might want to change to another directory. Can you tell which among those contents are also directories or just some plain files? Let's try this:

```shell
ls -l
```

You should see a list of contents, but with some extra information.
